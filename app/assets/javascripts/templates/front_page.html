        This is Manila. I built Manila because I've always been a list guy.
        Groceries? Make a list. Applying to jobs? Make a list! Ideas for a list project? First, make a list!

        This app is what I'd like to call a bucket map.
        Whether you're setting up a list for lunch or a list for life, pick a location on the map and then fill in the details!
        You can also check out other user's maps by viewing the home page, as well as search for specific users items.
